            <h3>THE BEGINNING</h3>
            <p>
              Matt developed his first website in middle school after his favorite online games at
              the time were blocked by the school's IT Administrator. The website he created was a
              way for himself, classmates to circumvent this block. He took his first
              freelance assignment as a web developer while he was in highschool using HTML, CSS, Image Maps, Wordpress. 
              He became better at HTML, CSS partially due to the popularity of the social media website Myspace and the

              also launched his first Wordpress blog that was a news aggregate for the affairs
